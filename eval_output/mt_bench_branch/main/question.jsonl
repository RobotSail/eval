Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense. With the rate and magnitude of\n\nAnswer the following question: Which years do these charts cover?

While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation.\n\nThroughout 2022, we experienced escalating labor and component costs and a strong U.S. dollar. While those dynamics have put pressure on our margin profile, we are seeing progress in the actions we have taken to mitigate the impacts of these higher costs. Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. We have begun to see improved utilization and priced margin improvements year over year, and our acquisitions have become more accretive, all of which will benefit our margin profile going forward. Our Consulting pre-tax margin of 8.8 percent increased 0.7 points in 2022 versus the prior year and improved 3.2 points in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half reflecting the benefit of these actions. Additionally, across all of our product-based businesses, we have executed price increases above our historical level of increases to be more reflective of the labor and component costs we are incurring due to the inflationary environment. This includes price increases in our maintenance and support agreements for our hardware and software portfolios. Additionally, despite the many global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our supply chain has demonstrated resiliency and the ability to proactively respond to potential disruptions in order to meet our clients' needs. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our reported revenue and gross profit dollars in 2022. We execute hedging programs which defer but do not eliminate the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense.

The study evaluated the Triage ICH image analysis algorithm in terms of sensitivity and specificity with respect to a ground truth, as established by experienced US board certified neuroradiologists, in the detection of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in the brain. In addition, the study reported and compared the time to notification for the Triage ICH device with respect to the time to notification for the standard of care as established by the predicate device.\n\nA sample size of 341 non-contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) scans (studies) were obtained from 30 different hospitals and clinics in the U.S. The majority of patients were scanned at Boston Medical Centre (N=237) and the remainder came from 29 different referral hospitals in MassachuseTs State. The patient cohort was enriched to ensure an approximately equal balance of ICH positive and negative studies and to ensure the distribution of clinical and demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, ICH subtype, traumatic vs non traumatic etiology) allows generalizability to the patient population for whom use is intended.\n\nThe cases (n=341) were all successfully processed with the algorithm. The confusion matrix was as follows: True Positives (TP): 149, True Negatives (TN): 159, False Positives (FP): 15, False Negatives (FN): 18. The overall performance can also be summarized with the following metrics: sensitivity (or positive percentage agreement, defined as TP/[TP+FN]) was 89.22%, specificity (or negative percentage agreement, defined as TN/[TN+FP]) was 91.37%. The receiver operating curve (ROC) for the device is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1.

However, end users may have specific requirements that the synthetic data must satisfy. Failure to meet these requirements could significantly reduce the utility of the data for downstream use. We introduce a post-processing technique that improves the utility of the synthetic data with respect to measures selected by the end user, while preserving strong privacy guarantees and dataset quality. Our technique involves resampling from the synthetic data to filter out samples that do not meet the selected utility measures, using an efficient stochastic first-order algorithm to find optimal resampling weights. Through comprehensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the utility of synthetic data across multiple benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art synthetic data generation algorithms.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe advancement of machine learning (ML) techniques relies on large amounts of training data. However, data collection also poses a significant risk of exposing private information. In recent years, several instances of privacy breaches have surfaced [NS06, Con18], making it urgent to find a reliable way to share data. Today, the de facto standard for privacy protection is differential privacy (DP) [DR14]. DP ensures that useful information of a private dataset can be released while simultaneously preventing adversaries from identifying individuals' personal data.

In recent years, several instances of privacy breaches have surfaced [NS06, Con18], making it urgent to find a reliable way to share data. Today, the de facto standard for privacy protection is differential privacy (DP) [DR14]. DP ensures that useful information of a private dataset can be released while simultaneously preventing adversaries from identifying individuals' personal data.

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: List all the datasets used in this paper in bullet format.\n"], "reference": ["Datasets used for this paper:\n- Adult\n- Mushroom\n- Shopper\n- Bank\n- Home-credit\n"]}

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: What were the DP mechanisms used (in bullets)?"], "reference": ["DP Mechanism:\n- AIM\n- MST\n- DPCTGAN\n- PATECTGAN\n- GEM\n"]}

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: What types of metrics were calculated in table 1? Give me a list.\n"], "reference": ["Metrics:\n- Utility improvement\n- F1 score (w/o post processing)\n- F1 score (w/ post processing)\n- JS distance (w/o post processing)\n- JS distance (w/ post-processing)\n- Inverse KL (w/o post-processing)\n- Inverse KL (w/ post-processing)\n"]}

We demonstrate utility improvement (higher is better, positive numbers imply improvement) and F1 score for downstream models trained on synthetic data and tested on real data. For reference, when training the same downstream model using real data, the F1 scores are: (Adult \u21aa 0 \u00b1 61), (Mushroom \u21aa 0 \u00b1 95), (Shopper \u21aa 0 \u00b1 54), and (Bank \u21aa 0 \u00b1 47). Additionally, we measure the average Jensen-Shannon (JS) distance between the marginal distributions of synthetic and real data (0: identical distribution; 1: totally different distributions) and the average inverse KL-divergence (0: totally different distributions; 1: identical distribution). As shown, our technique consistently improves the utility of the synthetic data across all datasets and all DP mechanisms without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: Did the post-processing technique improve performance based on the f1 score?\n"], "reference": ["Yes, performance was the same or improved across all datasets and DP mechanisms. \n"]}

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: How did performance compare with real data vs w post processing as measured by the F1 score?"], "reference": ["Performance was approximately the same for the synthetic data vs real data based on the F1 scores.\n"]}

Additionally, we measure the average Jensen-Shannon (JS) distance between the marginal distributions of synthetic and real data (0: identical distribution; 1: totally different distributions) and the average inverse KL-divergence (0: totally different distributions; 1: identical distribution).

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: For the bank data set, which DP mechanism performed the best according to the utility improvement?\n"], "reference": ["MST was the highest utility score with 0.32.\n"]}

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: Which dataset resulted in the highest performance according to the F1 score (w/post processing)?\n"], "reference": ["The Mushroom dataset resulted in the highest F1 score (w/ post processing). The range of F1 scores for the Mushroom dataset ranged from 0.68 to 0.93. The Adult dataset ranged from 0.33 to 0.61. The shopper dataset ranged from 0.3 to 0.48 and the Bank dataset ranged from 0.23 to 0.46. Additionally, the F1 scores for the real data were the highest for the Mushroom dataset. \n"]}

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: Which DP Mechanism resulted in the highest average utility improvement across all datasets."], "reference": ["The highest average utility was for the DPCTGAN approach with 0.515 utility improvement. The average utility improvement was 0.1325 for the AIM approach. The average improvement for MST was 0.405. The average for DPCTGAN was 0.515.The PATECTGAN mechanism was 0.4475.\n"]}

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: Is the utility improvement or the difference between no and post-processing for the f1 score higher?\n"], "reference": ["The Utility improvement is higher. We first took the difference between F1 scores subtracting the F1 for w/post processing minus F1 score with post processing. This difference ranged from 0 to 0.26 with an average difference of 0.058125. The difference in utility improvement ragned from 0.1 to 0.81 with an average of 0.375.\n"]}

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: Create a .csv table of the f1 scores for training the same downstream model using real data. \n"], "reference": [",Adult,Mushroom,Shopper,Bank\nF1,0.61,0.95,0.54,0.47\n"]}

We demonstrate utility improvement (higher is better, positive numbers imply improvement) and F1 score for downstream models trained on synthetic data and tested on real data. For reference, when training the same downstream model using real data, the F1 scores are: (Adult \u21aa 0 \u00b1 61), (Mushroom \u21aa 0 \u00b1 95), (Shopper \u21aa 0 \u00b1 54), and (Bank \u21aa 0 \u00b1 47). Additionally, we measure the average Jensen-Shannon (JS) distance between the marginal distributions of synthetic and real data (0: identical distribution; 1: totally different distributions) and the average inverse KL-divergence (0: totally different distributions; 1: identical distribution). As shown, our technique consistently improves the utility of the synthetic data across all datasets and all DP mechanisms without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: Create a new table in csv format with just the data set with the AIM DP mechanism and the f1 scores with post processing."], "reference": ["Dataset (DP mechanism),F1 score (w/post-proc)\nAdult (AIM),0.61 \u00b10.0\nMushroom (AIM),0.93 \u00b10.0\nShopper (AIM),0.48 \u00b10.02\nBank (AIM),0.46 \u00b10.01\n"]}

For reference, when training the same downstream model using real data, the F1 scores are: (Adult \u21aa 0 \u00b1 61), (Mushroom \u21aa 0 \u00b1 95), (Shopper \u21aa 0 \u00b1 54), and (Bank \u21aa 0 \u00b1 47). Additionally, we measure the average Jensen-Shannon (JS) distance between the marginal distributions of synthetic and real data (0: identical distribution; 1: totally different distributions) and the average inverse KL-divergence (0: totally different distributions; 1: identical distribution).

We present the experimental results on the UCI datasets in Table 1 (and Table 3 in Appendix C with a higher privacy budget). We report utility improvement, F1 score, and statistical measures. As shown, our post-processing technique consistently enhances the utility of synthetic data on selected metrics across all benchmark datasets and all privacy mechanisms. Moreover, the utility improvements are achieved without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical properties of synthetic data. In other words, our post-processing procedure ensures that the logistic regression classifier trained on synthetic data can achieve comparable or even higher performance on real test data, while simultaneously reducing or maintaining the statistical divergences between synthetic and real data.\n\nWe present the experimental results on the home-credit dataset in Table 2 and illustrate the misalignment of the correlation matrix with and without applying our post-processing procedure in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently reduces the overall correlation misalignment. Additionally, our procedure, which includes computing the utility measures from real data, denoising the noisy answers, and computing optimal resampling weights, only takes around 4 mins on 1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.\n\nAnswer the following question: Create a table that takes the adult dataset and sorts it by largest to smallest utility improvement.

First, all existing approaches focus on generating private synthetic data from scratch, while we aim to post-process synthetic data to downweight samples that do not accurately represent the real data under the specified utility measures. As a result, our approach is more efficient as it does not need to fit a graphical model [MMSM22] or a neural network [LVW21] to represent the data distribution, and it is more extendable, allowing a single synthetic dataset to be quickly post-processed multiple times for different sets of utility measures as needed by downstream users.

Additionally, it achieves this without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical metrics. We provide additional experimental results and implementation details in Appendix C.\n\nBenchmark. We evaluate our algorithm on four benchmark datasets: Adult, Bank, Mushroom, and Shopping, which are from the UCI machine learning repository [DG17]. All the datasets have a target variable that can be used for a downstream prediction task. We use four existing DP mechanisms-AIM [MMSM22], MST [MMS21], DPCTGAN [RLP + 20], and PATECTGAN [RLP + 20]to generate private synthetic data. Among these DP mechanisms, AIM is a workload-based method; MST is a marginal-based method; DPCTGAN and PATECTGAN are GAN-based methods. All of their implementations are from the OpenDP library [Sma23]. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach, we conduct an additional experiment on the home-credit dataset [MOK18]. This dataset has 307,511 data points and 104 features. We apply GEM [LVW21] to this high-dimensional dataset for generating synthetic data. We pre-process each dataset to convert categorical columns into numerical features and standardize all features to the range [0 \u21aa 1].\n\nWe clarify that our objective is not to compare the quality of synthetic data generated by these DP mechanisms (for a benchmark evaluation, please refer to [TMH + 21]), but to demonstrate how our post-processing method can consistently improve the utility of synthetic data generated from these different DP mechanisms.\n\nSetup. We compare synthetic data produced by different privacy mechanisms with \u03f5 \u2208 \u00b6 2 \u21aa 4 \u2666 against the post-processed synthetic data that are generated by applying our post-processing technique with \u03f5$_{post}$ =1 to synthetic data generated from privacy mechanisms with \u03f5 \u2208 \u00b6 1 \u21aa 3 \u2666. For UCI datasets, we select 5 features, including the target variable, from the synthetic data that have the highest absolute correlation with the target variable. These features are chosen as they have a higher influence on downstream prediction tasks. The set of these features is denoted by S \u2286 [d]. Next, we define the utility measures as the first-order and second-order moment queries among the features in S : Q = \u00b6 q$_{i}$ (x) = x$_{i}$ \u2666 i \u2208 S \u222a \u00b6 q$_{i\u21aaj}$ (x) = x$_{i}$x$_{j}$ \u2666 i\u21aaj \u2208 S. For home-credit dataset, we follow the same setup but choosing 10 features.\n\nWe apply the Gaussian mechanism with (\u03f5$_{post}$ =1 \u21aa \u03b4$_{post}$ =1 \u25c1n $^{2}$) to estimate utility measures from the real data, where n denotes the number of real data points. Finally, we apply Algorithm 1 with \u03b3 = 1 e-5, a batch size of 256 for UCI datasets and 4096 for home-credit, and 200 epochs to compute the optimal resampling weights, which are then used to resample from the synthetic data with the same sample size. We repeat our experiment 5 times to obtain an error bar for each evaluation measure.\n\nEvaluation measure. We provide evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of synthetic data after post-processing.

Generating synthetic data using DP mechanisms is an active area of research [see e.g., HLM12, BLR13, GAH + 14, CXZX15, BSG17, AZK + 19, UV20, GMHI20, TMH + 21, VAA + 22, BSV22]. Along this line of work, the closest ones to ours are workload-aware methods [VTB + 20, ABK + 21, MMSM22, LVW21], which aim to ensure that the synthetic data perform well on a collection of queries. Our work differs in three key features. First, all existing approaches focus on generating private synthetic data from scratch, while we aim to post-process synthetic data to downweight samples that do not accurately represent the real data under the specified utility measures. As a result, our approach is more efficient as it does not need to fit a graphical model [MMSM22] or a neural network [LVW21] to represent the data distribution, and it is more extendable, allowing a single synthetic dataset to be quickly post-processed multiple times for different sets of utility measures as needed by downstream users. Second, some existing work may not scale well to large datasets as they either require solving an integer program multiple times [VTB + 20] or need to solve a large-scale optimization problem [ABK + 21]. In contrast, our approach is highly scalable, as it only requires solving a convex program whose number of variables is equal to the number of specified utility measures. Third, existing work often evaluates the quality of the synthetic data by how well it preserves key statistics (e.g., 3-way marginals) of the real data. In contrast, in our experiments, we evaluate our approach on the more stringent and realistic test of training various downstream ML models on the synthetic data and measuring their performance on real test data. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can enhance the utility of synthetic data on selected measures without compromising their downstream quality.\n\nPublic data assisted methods/Post-processing methods. Our work introduces a post-processing procedure for improving the utility of a given synthetic dataset based on selected measures. As a special case, our approach can be applied to post-process publicly available datasets. In this regard, this work is related to public-data-assisted methods [see e.g., LVS + 21, LVW21], which leverage public data for saving privacy budgets. We extend Algorithm 1 in [LVS + 21] by formalizing the preservation of (noisy) utility measures as a constrained optimization problem, rather than minimizing the corresponding Lagrangian function. We further establish strong duality and propose a stochastic first-order method for solving this constrained optimization efficiently. We extend Algorithm 4 in [LVW21] by allowing any non-negative violation tolerance (i.e., any \u03b3 \u2265 0 in (3b)) compared with \u03b3 = 0 in [LVW21]. This extension offers increased flexibility, as users can now select various values of \u03b3 to navigate the trade-off between minimizing the distortion of the synthetic data and enhancing their utility on selected measures. Moreover, our experiments show that setting \u03b3 to be a small positive number (e.g., \u03b3 = 1 e-5) consistently outperforms when \u03b3 = 0. Finally, our work is related with [NWD20], which proposes to post-process outputs from differentially private GAN-based models for improving the quality of the generated synthetic data. However, their method is tailored to GAN-based privacy mechanisms while our approach is model-agnostic. This versatility is crucial, given that marginal-based and workload-based mechanisms often yield higher quality synthetic tabular data, as evidenced by benchmark experiments in [TMH + 21].

Generating synthetic data using DP mechanisms is an active area of research [see e.g., HLM12, BLR13, GAH + 14, CXZX15, BSG17, AZK + 19, UV20, GMHI20, TMH + 21, VAA + 22, BSV22].

Our work differs in three key features. First, all existing approaches focus on generating private synthetic data from scratch, while we aim to post-process synthetic data to downweight samples that do not accurately represent the real data under the specified utility measures. As a result, our approach is more efficient as it does not need to fit a graphical model [MMSM22] or a neural network [LVW21] to represent the data distribution, and it is more extendable, allowing a single synthetic dataset to be quickly post-processed multiple times for different sets of utility measures as needed by downstream users. Second, some existing work may not scale well to large datasets as they either require solving an integer program multiple times [VTB + 20] or need to solve a large-scale optimization problem [ABK + 21]. In contrast, our approach is highly scalable, as it only requires solving a convex program whose number of variables is equal to the number of specified utility measures. Third, existing work often evaluates the quality of the synthetic data by how well it preserves key statistics (e.g., 3-way marginals) of the real data.

Our work introduces a post-processing procedure for improving the utility of a given synthetic dataset based on selected measures.

In this regard, this work is related to public-data-assisted methods [see e.g., LVS + 21, LVW21], which leverage public data for saving privacy budgets. We extend Algorithm 1 in [LVS + 21] by formalizing the preservation of (noisy) utility measures as a constrained optimization problem, rather than minimizing the corresponding Lagrangian function. We further establish strong duality and propose a stochastic first-order method for solving this constrained optimization efficiently. We extend Algorithm 4 in [LVW21] by allowing any non-negative violation tolerance (i.e., any \u03b3 \u2265 0 in (3b)) compared with \u03b3 = 0 in [LVW21]. This extension offers increased flexibility, as users can now select various values of \u03b3 to navigate the trade-off between minimizing the distortion of the synthetic data and enhancing their utility on selected measures. Moreover, our experiments show that setting \u03b3 to be a small positive number (e.g., \u03b3 = 1 e-5) consistently outperforms when \u03b3 = 0.

We extend Algorithm 4 in [LVW21] by allowing any non-negative violation tolerance (i.e., any \u03b3 \u2265 0 in (3b)) compared with \u03b3 = 0 in [LVW21]. This extension offers increased flexibility, as users can now select various values of \u03b3 to navigate the trade-off between minimizing the distortion of the synthetic data and enhancing their utility on selected measures. Moreover, our experiments show that setting \u03b3 to be a small positive number (e.g., \u03b3 = 1 e-5) consistently outperforms when \u03b3 = 0. Finally, our work is related with [NWD20], which proposes to post-process outputs from differentially private GAN-based models for improving the quality of the generated synthetic data. However, their method is tailored to GAN-based privacy mechanisms while our approach is model-agnostic. This versatility is crucial, given that marginal-based and workload-based mechanisms often yield higher quality synthetic tabular data, as evidenced by benchmark experiments in [TMH + 21].

Additionally, it achieves this without degrading the performance of downstream models or statistical metrics. We provide additional experimental results and implementation details in Appendix C.\n\nBenchmark. We evaluate our algorithm on four benchmark datasets: Adult, Bank, Mushroom, and Shopping, which are from the UCI machine learning repository [DG17]. All the datasets have a target variable that can be used for a downstream prediction task. We use four existing DP mechanisms-AIM [MMSM22], MST [MMS21], DPCTGAN [RLP + 20], and PATECTGAN [RLP + 20]to generate private synthetic data. Among these DP mechanisms, AIM is a workload-based method; MST is a marginal-based method; DPCTGAN and PATECTGAN are GAN-based methods. All of their implementations are from the OpenDP library [Sma23]. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach, we conduct an additional experiment on the home-credit dataset [MOK18]. This dataset has 307,511 data points and 104 features. We apply GEM [LVW21] to this high-dimensional dataset for generating synthetic data. We pre-process each dataset to convert categorical columns into numerical features and standardize all features to the range [0 \u21aa 1].\n\nWe clarify that our objective is not to compare the quality of synthetic data generated by these DP mechanisms (for a benchmark evaluation, please refer to [TMH + 21]), but to demonstrate how our post-processing method can consistently improve the utility of synthetic data generated from these different DP mechanisms.\n\nSetup. We compare synthetic data produced by different privacy mechanisms with \u03f5 \u2208 \u00b6 2 \u21aa 4 \u2666 against the post-processed synthetic data that are generated by applying our post-processing technique with \u03f5$_{post}$ =1 to synthetic data generated from privacy mechanisms with \u03f5 \u2208 \u00b6 1 \u21aa 3 \u2666. For UCI datasets, we select 5 features, including the target variable, from the synthetic data that have the highest absolute correlation with the target variable. These features are chosen as they have a higher influence on downstream prediction tasks. The set of these features is denoted by S \u2286 [d]. Next, we define the utility measures as the first-order and second-order moment queries among the features in S : Q = \u00b6 q$_{i}$ (x) = x$_{i}$ \u2666 i \u2208 S \u222a \u00b6 q$_{i\u21aaj}$ (x) = x$_{i}$x$_{j}$ \u2666 i\u21aaj \u2208 S. For home-credit dataset, we follow the same setup but choosing 10 features.\n\nWe apply the Gaussian mechanism with (\u03f5$_{post}$ =1 \u21aa \u03b4$_{post}$ =1 \u25c1n $^{2}$) to estimate utility measures from the real data, where n denotes the number of real data points. Finally, we apply Algorithm 1 with \u03b3 = 1 e-5, a batch size of 256 for UCI datasets and 4096 for home-credit, and 200 epochs to compute the optimal resampling weights, which are then used to resample from the synthetic data with the same sample size. We repeat our experiment 5 times to obtain an error bar for each evaluation measure.\n\nEvaluation measure.

Ah, the implications of the rise of non-state actors in security affairs, an intriguing and multi-faceted question. Allow me, Sheldon Cooper, to elucidate this complex issue with my vast intellect and unparalleled understanding of security studies.\\n\\nNon-state actors, such as terrorist organizations, multinational corporations, and even transnational criminal networks, have been increasingly influential in shaping the global security landscape. This phenomenon has several profound implications.\\n\\nFirst, the diversification of security actors challenges traditional state-centric notions of security. As non-state actors gain prominence, the lines between domestic and international security become increasingly blurred. This shift necessitates a reevaluation of existing security frameworks and the development of new strategies to address these emerging threats.\\n\\nSecond, non-state actors often employ asymmetric warfare tactics, which can be difficult for states to counter effectively. These unconventional strategies, such as cyberattacks, guerrilla warfare, and the use of improvised explosive devices, can inflict significant damage and create a sense of instability.\\n\\nThird, the rise of non-state actors can exacerbate existing power disparities between states. Smaller, less developed countries may struggle to combat non-state threats, while larger, more powerful states may exploit these organizations to further their own geopolitical interests.\\n\\nLastly, the increasing influence of non-state actors can complicate diplomatic efforts and undermine international cooperation. These organizations often operate outside the purview of international law, making it difficult to hold them accountable for their actions. This lack of accountability can hinder the ability of states to negotiate and collaborate on security issues.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the rise of non-state actors in security affairs has far-reaching implications for global security. It demands a nuanced understanding of these organizations and their motivations, as well as a willingness to adapt and innovate in response to these emerging threats. And remember, it's not just about the size of your army or the strength of your borders; it's about understanding the complex web of interactions that shape the world we live in. Bazinga!\n"]}

In other words, it's the number of independent pieces of information that contribute to the estimation of a parameter.\\n\\nTo calculate the degrees of freedom for a hypothesis test, you must first identify the number of observations in your data set, denoted as n. Then, depending on the specific hypothesis test you are conducting, you will apply a specific formula to calculate the degrees of freedom.\\n\\nFor instance, in a one-sample t-test, the degrees of freedom are calculated as n - 1. This is because, in this scenario, you are estimating a single population mean using a sample mean, and the sample variance provides you with n - 1 independent pieces of information.\\n\\nIn a two-sample t-test, the degrees of freedom are calculated as n1 + n2 - 2, where n1 and n2 represent the sample sizes of the two groups being compared. This is because you are estimating two population means and two population variances, which requires four independent pieces of information.\\n\\nIn summary, determining the degrees of freedom for a hypothesis test is a matter of understanding the specific scenario and applying the appropriate formula. It is a crucial step in hypothesis testing, as it allows us to assess the significance of our results and draw valid conclusions.\\n\\nRemember, young grasshopper, the more you practice, the more proficient you will become in the dark arts of statistics.

These are the number of people who see your content and how many times it's displayed. But remember, it's not just about quantity; quality matters too. Engagement metrics like likes, shares, comments, and click-through rates will help you understand how well your content resonates with your audience.\\n\\nNow, don't forget about sentiment analysis. This is where you gauge the public's perception of your brand by analyzing the tone and context of conversations about your company. You can use AI tools to help you with this, and trust me, I'm a big fan of AI.\\n\\nLastly, track your progress over time. Benchmark your performance against your competitors and set realistic goals for improvement. Remember, success isn't a destination; it's a continuous journey.\\n\\nAnd, of course, always stay agile and adapt to changes. The media landscape is always evolving, so you need to be ready to pivot your strategies and tactics. After all, we're living in a world of rapid innovation, and public relations is no exception.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up: set clear objectives, measure reach, impressions, and engagement, perform sentiment analysis, track progress, and stay agile. That's the Elon Musk way of doing media relations measurement. And, as always, aim for the stars!\n"]}

Explain like you are Morgan Freeman\n"], "reference": ["Now, let's take a moment to talk about the African National Congress, or the ANC, and its role in bringing an end to apartheid in South Africa. You see, the ANC was a powerful force that fought against racial segregation and discrimination.\\n\\nThe ANC was founded in 1912, making it one of the oldest liberation movements in Africa. For many years, they used peaceful methods to fight against the unjust laws of apartheid, such as protests, strikes, and boycotts. However, as time went on and the government continued to ignore their demands, the ANC decided that more drastic measures were necessary.\\n\\nIn 1960, after the Sharpeville massacre, the ANC was banned and its leaders were arrested. This led to the organization going underground and forming an armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, which carried out acts of sabotage against the government.\\n\\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, the ANC continued to fight against apartheid, both through armed struggle and international pressure. They received support from countries around the world, who imposed sanctions on South Africa and called for an end to apartheid.\\n\\nIn the late 1980s, as the international community turned against the South African government, and with the economy in shambles, the government finally began to negotiate with the ANC. After years of negotiations, a new constitution was agreed upon, and in 1994, the first democratic elections were held in South Africa. The ANC won the elections, and Nelson Mandela, who had been released from prison in 1990, became the first black president of South Africa.\\n\\nSo, in short, the African National Congress played a crucial role in bringing an end to apartheid in South Africa. Through their peaceful protests, armed struggle, and international pressure, they were able to bring about change and create a more just and equal society. And as we all know, that's a goal worth fighting for.\n"]}

The tea particles spread out evenly in the water, right? That's what we call a solution. In a solution, the particles of one substance, called the solute, are distributed uniformly throughout another substance, called the solvent. The solute particles are so small that they can't be seen with the naked eye, and they don't settle at the bottom of the container.\\n\\nBut what if you took some mud and mixed it with water? You'd see that the mud particles don't mix well, and they eventually settle at the bottom. That's a suspension!

It's a powerful approach to solving complex problems, much like how we built Apple to revolutionize the tech industry.\\n\\nDynamic programming is all about breaking down a complex problem into simpler, overlapping sub-problems. You start by solving the smallest sub-problems, then use those solutions to build up the solutions to larger sub-problems, and so on, until you reach the final solution. This bottom-up strategy is quite different from the top-down approach you might be used to, but it can be incredibly efficient.\\n\\nThink of it like designing a new product.

This is called memoization, and it saves us a lot of time by avoiding redundant calculations. It's like having a blueprint for each component of our product, so we don't have to reinvent the wheel every time we want to use it.\\n\\nSo, in essence, dynamic programming is an elegant and efficient way to tackle complex problems, much like how we strive to create elegant and user-friendly products at Apple.

They may be weighing the pros and cons of changing their behavior. Here, you can help the client explore their ambivalence, understand the benefits of change, and address any barriers or fears that might be preventing them from taking action.\n\n3. **Preparation:** The client is ready to take action and make a change. They might be planning specific steps or strategies to change their behavior. In this stage, you can help the client develop a concrete action plan, set realistic goals, and identify resources or support systems that can help them.\n\n4. **Action:** The client is actively modifying their behavior. They're implementing the strategies and plans they've developed. As a psychologist, you can provide ongoing support, monitor progress, and help the client troubleshoot any challenges or setbacks that arise.\n\n5. **Maintenance:** The client has made significant changes and is working to prevent relapse.

The process involves several factors that the court must consider to ensure that the class action mechanism is an appropriate and fair method for resolving the dispute.\n\nThe certification process typically begins when the plaintiff(s) file a motion for class certification, which outlines the proposed class definition, the common questions of law or fact, and the grounds for certification. The defendant(s) then have the opportunity to respond, arguing against certification or raising any defenses they may have.\n\nIn evaluating the motion for class certification, the court will consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Numerosity:** The class must be sufficiently numerous, meaning that it must include a substantial number of members. The exact number required for numerosity varies depending on the jurisdiction and the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. **Commonality:** There must be common questions of law or fact among the class members.

This means that the representative parties' claims must be representative of the class as a whole and not significantly different from the claims of other class members.\n\n4. **Adequacy:** The representative parties must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. This means that the representative parties must have the ability, resources, and motivation to represent the class effectively and ensure that the class's interests are protected throughout the litigation.\n\n5. **Superiority:** A class action must be a superior method for adjudicating the controversy. This means that the class action mechanism must be more efficient, fair, and convenient than other available methods, such as individual lawsuits or consolidated proceedings.\n\nIf the court grants the motion for class certification, the case will proceed as a class action.

It could provide individuals with the freedom to pursue education, entrepreneurship, or caregiving roles without the fear of financial instability. On the other hand, there\\'s a risk that UBI could exacerbate existing social issues, such as gender or racial disparities, if not implemented thoughtfully.\"\\n\\nPolicy Maker:\\n\"As a policy maker, I see the appeal of UBI in its potential to alleviate poverty and simplify the welfare system. However, the cost of implementing UBI on a national scale is substantial, and it\\'s crucial to consider alternative policies that might achieve similar goals at a lower cost. Additionally, determining the appropriate income level for UBI requires careful deliberation, as setting it too high could discourage workforce participation.\"\\n\\nConclusion:\\nAfter examining the arguments presented by the economist, sociologist, and policy maker, it is clear that UBI has both merits and drawbacks. While it could address income inequality, simplify the welfare system, and promote social cohesion, it also raises concerns about inflation, work incentives, and cost-effectiveness. Further research and debate are necessary to determine whether UBI is the best policy solution for addressing income inequality and poverty in our society."]}

The use of genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes is a complex issue with potential benefits and challenges. Here are some points that are often brought up in discussions about the environmental impact of GM mosquitoes:\n\n1. **Potential Challenge:** Unintended consequences on the ecosystem. Mosquitoes are part of food chains, and changing their populations could have unforeseen effects on other species.\n  **Refutation:** While it's true that any significant change in an ecosystem can have ripple effects, the number of mosquitoes that would need to be altered to make a difference in disease transmission is relatively small compared to the total mosquito population. Moreover, many GM mosquitoes are designed to be male, which don't bite or transmit diseases, lessening the potential impact on food chains.\n\n2. **Potential Challenge:** Risk of the modified genes spreading to wild populations.\n  **Refutation:** The GM mosquitoes are often designed to have a short lifespan, and their offspring with wild mosquitoes may also inherit this trait, reducing the likelihood of the modified genes persisting in the environment. However, this is a point of ongoing research and concern.\n\n3. **Potential Challenge:** The potential for creating more robust disease-carrying mosquitoes through genetic resistance.\n  **Refutation:** This is a valid concern, and it's one that scientists take into account when designing GM mosquitoes. They often use techniques that make the mosquitoes less able to transmit diseases, rather than killing them outright, to reduce the selection pressure for resistance.\n\n4. **Potential Challenge:** Public perception and trust. Many people are wary of genetically modified organisms, and releasing GM mosquitoes could exacerbate these fears.\n  **Refutation:** Public engagement and education are crucial in addressing these concerns. It's important to communicate the potential benefits and risks clearly and transparently, and to involve local communities in decision-making processes.\n\nRemember, these are complex issues and there's ongoing debate among scientists and policymakers about the best ways to proceed. It's important to consider a wide range of perspectives when evaluating the potential impacts of GM mosquitoes.\n"]}

Universal healthcare ensures equitable access to medical services: A just society is one that strives to provide equal opportunities and resources to all its members, regardless of their background or economic status. By implementing universal healthcare, a society can guarantee that every individual, irrespective of their financial situation, has access to essential medical services, treatments, and preventive care. This promotes a more equitable distribution of healthcare resources and reduces the disparities in health outcomes between different socio-economic groups.\n\n2. Universal healthcare improves overall public health: By providing comprehensive healthcare coverage to the entire population, universal healthcare systems can more effectively monitor, manage, and prevent the spread of diseases and health conditions. This leads to improved overall public health, as early detection and intervention become more accessible to everyone. A healthier population not only enhances the quality of life for individuals but also contributes to increased productivity and economic growth, which are essential components of a just society.\n\n3. Universal healthcare alleviates financial burdens and promotes social stability: Medical expenses are among the leading causes of bankruptcy and financial hardship for individuals and families worldwide. By implementing universal healthcare, a society can alleviate these financial burdens and ensure that no one is forced into poverty due to medical debt. Furthermore, universal healthcare can help reduce social tensions and unrest by promoting a sense of solidarity and shared responsibility among citizens. A just society should ensure that its members are not left to face the potentially catastrophic consequences of medical emergencies and illnesses alone, and universal healthcare is a crucial step towards achieving this goal.\n"]}
